# Game of Life
Parallel implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python using MPI. This implementation was for academic purposes, it was a submission for my High Performance Computing class.  In the memory of [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) who sadly passed away on April 12th 2020.

## Rules of the Automaton
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

**NOTE:**
The code was run on the GWU super computing cluster, Colonial One.
